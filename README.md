# Rain and flood informed vehicle routing

In this project, we present a method for obtaining routes that avoid rain and floods in a city. To achieve this, we model a city’s road network as a weighted multigraph, use data on precipitation and flood occurrences, and employ well-known methods to solve the shortest path problem based on this data.

It was supervised by [Prof. Leonardo Souza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leonardo-Santos-2) (CEMADEN), [Prof. Luiz Leduíno Neto](https://sites.google.com/view/leduino/) (Unifesp) and [Prof. Horácio Yanasse](https://br.linkedin.com/in/horacio-yanasse-39289794?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fduckduckgo.com%2F) (Unifesp).
